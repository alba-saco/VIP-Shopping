# VIP-Shopping
About this project:

The purpose of this project was to investigate and implement a suitable solution to assist visually impaired people in having a more independent shopping experience,
i.e. having them require less help and grant them more autonomy in their consumer journey.
The aim was to conduct thorough research of existing solutions and technologies and to identify their limitations in order to build upon pre-existing work.
To overcome the challenges faced by visually impaired people in their shopping journeys, navigation and product identification must both be addressed.
Furthermore, a solution that is both accessible to these users and simple and inexpensive for stores to implementmust be rendered in order to create an integrated
and sustainable solution.

The final solution involved a system in which a user can query for an item and is then directed to the item with verbal navigation instructions.
A barcode scanner is also implemented so that the user can scan for the item to retrieve the item details.
This project folder contains the first prototype for this solution.

The testing showed promising results, indicating that the solution prototype makes a good start towards targeting the user pain points and addressing the
requirements outlined in the development stage.
Users were able to navigate the indoor space to access desired items and were able to identify items details without relying on their vision.
Thus, the proof-of-concept showed to ultimately be successful in achieving the outlined aims.
